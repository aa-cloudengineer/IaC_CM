# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) refers to the process of defining and managing infrastructure, such as servers, networks, and storage, through machine-readable files. This means that instead of manually configuring infrastructure, IaC tools enable teams to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure using code. This approach allows teams to treat infrastructure as code, which can be version-controlled, tested, and integrated into a continuous delivery pipeline.

IaC manages infrastructure using a descriptive model. Infrastructure includes networks, virtual machines, load balancers, to name a few. An IaC model produces the same environment every time it is applied.

Most common IaC Tools:

- [Terraform](https://github.com/aa-cloudengineer/IaC/tree/main/Terraform)
-   A popular IaC tool that enables teams to manage infrastructure resources such as servers, networks, and storage in a declarative way using a simple language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
