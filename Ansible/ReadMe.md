# Ansible
Ansible can be used to install software, automate daily tasks, provision infrastructure and network components, improve security and compliance, patch systems, and orchestrate complex workflows.
Ansible is an open source IT automation engine that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other IT processes.

# How does Ansible work?

## Modules
Ansible works by connecting to nodes (or hosts) and pushing out small programs—called modules—to these nodes. Nodes are the target endpoints—servers, network devices, or any computer—that you aim to manage with Ansible. Modules are used to accomplish automation tasks in Ansible. These programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules and removes them when finished.
